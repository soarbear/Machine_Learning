# Machine_Learning
Machine learning sample source code tested under Google Colaboratory for learning and practice. All samples are tested under Google Colaboratory. Some samples are from "Machine Learning in Action" written by Peter Harrington.
 - kNN

Discriminate handwritten numbers from 0 to 9 using k-NearNeighbor method. In the handwritten example, in the case of test data, the accuracy rate was 98.7%, so kNN is a classification method that can be used to recognize handwritten digits.

 - kd-tree
 
New point is the green one.The nearest point is the red one.
Select the dimension x with the largest variance in the k-dimensional data set, then select the median m as the middle point of the dimension and split the data set to get 2 subsets.
Repeat the process of above step for the 2 subsets until all subsets cannot be subdivided.
