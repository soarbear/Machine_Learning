# Machine_Learning
Machine learning sample source code tested under Google Colaboratory for learning and practice. All samples are tested under Google Colaboratory. Some samples are from "Machine Learning in Action" written by Peter Harrington.
 - kNN

Discriminate handwritten numbers from 0 to 9 using k-NearNeighbor method. In the handwritten example, in the case of test data, the accuracy rate was 98.7%, so kNN is a classification method that can be used to recognize handwritten digits.
